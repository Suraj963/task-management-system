Of course. Here is the updated README template with the "Live Demo" and "Screenshots" sections removed, and with information about using React Bootstrap included.

The most important part of "how to use" React Bootstrap in a README is telling users how to import its CSS so the styles work correctly.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/Suraj963/task-management-system.git]
cd task-management-system
```

### 2. Backend Setup

```bash
# Navigate to the backend folder
cd backend-task-management-system

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the server
npm start
```
The backend server will be running on `http://localhost:3004`.

### 3. Frontend Setup

```bash
# Navigate to the frontend folder from the root
cd frontend-task-management-system

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Create a .env file and add the backend API URL
# Example: REACT_APP_API_URL="http://localhost:3004/api/v1"

# Start the React app
npm start
```
The frontend will open and run on `http://localhost:3000`.

### Using React Bootstrap

For the component styling to work correctly, the main Bootstrap CSS file must be imported. Make sure the following line is present at the top of your `src/index.js` or `src/App.js` file:

```javascript
import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';
```
This is already included in the project, and `npm install` will ensure it's available.
